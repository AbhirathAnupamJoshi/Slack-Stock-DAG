Each file contains pinned resources from the corresponding channel on the Workspace.
The resources are in the form of lists only temporarily, until we finalise a good enough way to use and display a directed acyclic graph for the same. It is meaningful because:
* It's a waste to do two tutorials on the same topic only because the second one has a project.
* One can't do an advanced course without prereqs, but the advanced course will teach a lot.
* This is the way one usually follows while learning, just in a zigzag way. It'll be much more natural with a graph.
* Send PRs if you create / find resources other than the ones mentioned.
* This should especially help beginners who are unsure how to start with any topic.

Once the DAG is completely set up, the next aim is creating a template for everyone to comfortably keep flags on the resources they have finished (probably a red-green DAG). This will be really helpful in the long term, for this allows everyone to show what they know, both to others and themselves. A link to that page would be quite more efficient than a "Intermediate: C++/Python" on your resum√®

Apart from the abovementioned benefits over many pre-existing "[Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)" on Github, there's a sidelined benefit that helps a lot in the long run. That is, it is constrained, and biased. Created by seniors from the same university from the same country, this provides a very good path for a junior who'd find themselves in quite a similar situation.
