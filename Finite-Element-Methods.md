### What is Finite Element Analysis?

It is a computational model used to solve several problems in engineering. It is a numerical method that allows for discretisation of a partial differential equation and is hence one example of what is known as a "computer experiment" or a "simulation experiemnt".

It must be noted that while Finite Element Analysis is primarily taught in Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering courses, it's applications are broad, interdisciplinary and at the end of the day helps in forming computational simulations.
