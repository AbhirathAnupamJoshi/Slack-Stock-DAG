# Theoretical CS Resource List

- [TheoremDep](https://sharmaeklavya2.github.io/theoremdep/):
Track Dependencies between Theorems

- [Computional Complexity Book by Arora and Barak (PDF)](https://theory.cs.princeton.edu/complexity/book.pdf):
Great for taking a deep dive in complexity theory.
If you're only interested in NP-completeness and basic complexity classes,
the first 3 chapters will be sufficient.

- Linear Programming:
    - Lecture notes by Tim Roughgarden:
    They're especially useful for people interested in building their basics for doing research in CS theory.
        - [lecture 1](http://timroughgarden.org/w16/l/l7.pdf): Introduction and Applications
        - [lecture 2](http://timroughgarden.org/w16/l/l8.pdf): Linear Programming Duality (Part 1)
        - [lecture 3](http://timroughgarden.org/w16/l/l9.pdf): Linear Programming Duality (Part 2)
        - [lecture 4](http://timroughgarden.org/w16/l/l10.pdf): The Minimax Theorem and Algorithms for Linear Programming
    - [How to find the dual of a complex linear program](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/coms6998-3/lpprimer.pdf):
        Useful if your linear program is hard to express in standard form.
